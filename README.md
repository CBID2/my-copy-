## In memory of Aaron Swartz

[The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc)

> **Note** This is a **must** watch documentary.

![Aaron Swartz](images/aaronswartz.jpg)

[Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) was a computer programmer, entrepreneur, and internet activist who made significant contributions to the development of the internet and the open access movement.

Aaron was born in 1986, and became interested in computers and the internet at a young age. He was a brilliant and talented programmer, and was known for his ability to quickly grasp and master new technologies. He co-authored the RSS 1.0 specification at the age of 14, and went on to work on a variety of other projects, including the development of the Creative Commons license, the building of the first consumer web feed platform, and the creation of the social news site Reddit.

Aaron was also a strong advocate for open access, which is the movement to make knowledge and information freely available to all, rather than being locked behind paywalls and controlled by a few powerful corporations or institutions. He believed that access to knowledge and information was a fundamental right, and that it should be freely available to everyone.

Aaron's work had a major impact on the development of the internet and the open access movement, and he is remembered as a pioneer and a hero by many in the tech community. Tragically, Aaron took his own life in 2013, at the age of 26. His legacy lives on through the work of those who continue to fight for open access and the free flow of information. Arrr!

## What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### What is GNU?

GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Richard Stallman in 1983. At the time, Stallman was a computer science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Stallman began working on GNU as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system in 1983. He made the source code for GNU available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

### What is open source software?

Open source software is software that is freely available to anyone who wants to use it, modify it, or distribute it. It is a model for software development that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code.

Open source software is often developed using a model called "open source development", which is a process that encourages collaboration and the sharing of ideas and code. In this model, the source code for the software is made available to the community, and anyone can contribute to the project by writing code, fixing bugs, or improving the software in some way.

#### What are open source licenses?

Open source licenses are legal documents that grant users the right to use, modify, and distribute open source software. They are used to protect the rights of the developers and users of open source software, and to ensure that the software remains free and open.

### What is the Linux kernel?

The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is a piece of software that acts as an interface between the hardware and the rest of the operating system, and is responsible for managing the resources of the computer and allocating them to the various applications and processes that are running.

The Linux kernel was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, and was released as open source software under the GNU General Public License. It is written in the C programming language, and is available for a wide variety of computer architectures, including x86, ARM, and PowerPC.

## Before we begin

Captain Jack stood at the helm of his ship, staring out at the vast expanse of the ocean. He had been a pirate for as long as he could remember, and he loved nothing more than the thrill of the hunt and the rush of adrenaline that came with finding treasure.

But Jack was no ordinary pirate. He was a master of technology, using his advanced gadgets and devices to outsmart his enemies and outmaneuver them on the high seas. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is equivalent to magic," he thought to himself, smiling at the thought of all the treasure he had acquired through his clever use of technology.

But even Jack knew that technology was not always the answer. He had learned the hard way that "social engineering bypasses all technologies, including firewalls." He had lost more than one treasure to clever pirates who used their charm and charisma to manipulate him and his crew.

Jack was not one to accept defeat easily, though. "People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world," he thought, determined to find a way to outsmart even the most clever of his rivals.

And so he set his sights on the greatest treasure of them all: the fabled Black Pearl, a ship that was said to be filled with unimaginable riches. Jack knew that he couldn't do it alone, though. He needed a crew of skilled pirates who were just as determined and clever as he was.

As he searched for the perfect crewmates, Jack couldn't help but think about the dangers of relying too much on technology. "The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers," he thought, knowing that it was important to keep a balance between using technology and using one's own intelligence and creativity.

Finally, Jack found the perfect crew. They were a diverse group, each with their own unique skills and talents. Together, they set off on their quest for the Black Pearl, using all of their combined knowledge and expertise to outsmart their enemies and navigate the dangerous waters.

As they sailed closer and closer to their goal, Jack couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and determination. "Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success," he thought, knowing that they would stop at nothing to claim the treasure that was rightfully theirs.

And in the end, their hard work paid off. They found the Black Pearl, and it was even more magnificent than they had imagined. "It doesn't matter what you know, what matters is when you know," Jack thought as he gazed at the treasure-filled ship, knowing that their knowledge and skills had been key to their success.

As they sailed back home, filled with treasure and stories to tell, Jack couldn't help but feel grateful for the diverse and skilled crew that he had assembled. He knew that it was their combined knowledge and creativity that had led them to victory, and he couldn't wait to see what other adventures they would have together in the future.

### Linux filesystem

Ahoy matey! Welcome to the world of Linux filesystems, where we navigate through the vast ocean of data like pirates searching for buried treasure.

In the Linux filesystem, everything is organized into a single tree structure, starting at the root directory represented by a forward slash (/). This root directory contains all the other directories and files on the system, and can be thought of as the base of the tree.

Within the root directory, there are several subdirectories that serve important functions. For example, the "home" directory (/home) is where each user on the system has their own personal space to store their files and documents. The "etc" directory (/etc) contains configuration files for the system, while the "bin" directory (/bin) stores executable programs that are used by the system and its users.

Just like on a pirate ship, each member of the crew has their own designated areas to store their belongings. Similarly, in the Linux filesystem, each user has their own home directory where they can store their files and personalize their environment.

But be warned, matey! Just like how a pirate's treasure is guarded by treacherous traps and obstacles, the Linux filesystem also has its own set of permissions and ownership rules. Only certain users are allowed access to certain files and directories, and it's up to the system administrator (the captain of the ship) to set these permissions and make sure everything is running smoothly.

So set sail and explore the seas of data, but always remember to respect the rules of the Linux filesystem and the hierarchies of ownership and access. Arrr!

#### Filesystem examples

Aye aye, matey! Here are some examples of common tasks that a pirate (or a Linux user) might encounter when using the Linux filesystem:

Navigating the filesystem: Just like how a pirate navigates the open seas, a Linux user can navigate the filesystem using the `cd` command to change directories and the `ls` command to list the contents of a directory. For example, to navigate to the root directory, a pirate might type `cd /`, and to see a list of the files and directories within the current directory, they might type `ls`.

Creating and deleting files and directories: A pirate might need to create a new file or directory to store their loot or maps. To do this, they can use the `touch` command to create a new file or the `mkdir` command to create a new directory. For example, to create a new file called `treasure_map.txt` within the current directory, a pirate might type `touch treasure_map.txt`. To delete a file or directory, they can use the `rm` command. For example, to delete the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `rm treasure_map.txt`.

Copying and moving files and directories: A pirate might need to copy or move a file or directory from one location to another, just like how they might need to move their treasure chest from one part of the ship to another. To copy a file or directory, a pirate can use the `cp` command, and to move a file or directory, they can use the `mv` command. For example, to copy the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `cp treasure_map.txt /home`. To move the file `treasure_map.txt` from the current directory to the home directory, a pirate might type `mv treasure_map.txt /home`.

Viewing and editing files: A pirate might need to view the contents of a file or edit it to update their treasure map. To view the contents of a file, a pirate can use the `cat` command, and to edit a file, they can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`. For example, to view the contents of the file `treasure_map.txt`, a pirate might type `cat treasure_map.txt`, and to edit the file `treasure_map.txt` using the `nano` text editor, they might type `nano treasure_map.txt`.

I hope these examples give you a better understanding of how the Linux filesystem works and how a pirate might use it to complete common tasks. Arrr!

#### Permissions

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, file permissions are like the rules and regulations that govern access to a pirate's treasure. Just like how a pirate might only allow certain members of their crew to access their treasure, in Linux, file permissions control who is allowed to read, write, and execute specific files and directories.

Each file and directory in the Linux filesystem has an owner and a group associated with it. The owner is the user who created the file or directory, and the group is a collection of users that the owner can assign permissions to. File permissions can be set for the owner, the group, and everyone else (referred to as "others").

There are three types of permissions that can be set for each file or directory: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. The write permission allows a user to modify or delete a file or add or remove files from a directory. The execute permission allows a user to execute a file as a program or to enter a directory and access its contents.

File permissions can be displayed using the `ls -l` command, which shows a list of files and directories along with their permissions. For example, the output might look something like this:

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 pirate pirate 4096 Jan 1 00:00 treasure_chest
```

The first character (d) indicates that this is a directory. The next three characters (rwx) represent the permissions for the owner, the next three (r-x) represent the permissions for the group, and the final three (r-x) represent the permissions for others.

To change the permissions of a file or directory, a pirate can use the `chmod` command. For example, to give the owner and the group read and write permissions for the file `treasure_map.txt`, but only read permission for others, a pirate might type `chmod 640 treasure_map.txt`.

I hope this helps you understand how file permissions work in Linux and how a pirate might use them to control access to their treasures. Arrr!

### Networking

[PacketLife](https://packetlife.net/)

`ip`: This command be used to configure network interfaces on yer system. Ye can use it to view information about yer network interfaces, set their IP addresses, and more.

`ping`: This command be used to test the connectivity between two devices on a network. Ye can use it to check if yer system be able to reach another device on the network.

`traceroute`: This command be used to trace the route between yer system and another device on the network. Ye can use it to see the path that packets be taking between yer system and the destination.

`netstat`: This command be used to display information about yer system's network connections and routing tables. Ye can use it to view information about active connections and network routes.

`route`: This command be used to view and modify the routing table on yer system. Ye can use it to add, delete, or modify routes on yer system.

### Bash

Ahoy matey! Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Just like how a pirate might use a compass to navigate through the open seas, Bash helps users navigate and interact with their operating system by allowing them to enter commands and execute programs.

Bash is a powerful tool that allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks, including running programs, creating and editing files and directories, and managing system processes. It also provides features like command history, tab completion, and shell scripting, which allow users to automate tasks and customize their environment.

To use Bash, a pirate would open a terminal window and type commands at the prompt. The prompt is a symbol that indicates that Bash is ready to accept commands, and it usually looks something like this:

```bash
pirate@cove:~$
```

The prompt includes the username (pirate), the hostname (cove), and the current working directory (indicated by the tilde character).

Bash supports a wide variety of commands, including built-in commands like `ls` (list the contents of a directory) and `cd` (change the current working directory), as well as external programs like `grep` (search for patterns in text) and `awk` (process text).

I hope this helps you understand what Bash is and how a pirate might use it to interact with their operating system. Arrr!

#### .bashrc

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.bashrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user logs in to their system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.bashrc` file can be used to customize a user's environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.bashrc` file might look something like this:

```bash
# Set the prompt to include the current time
PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h \[\e[33m\]\w\[\e[35m\] \t\[\e[m\]\$ "

# Set the default editor to Vim
export EDITOR=vim

# Set an alias for the ls command
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

The first line sets the prompt to include the current time. The second line sets the default editor to Vim. The third line sets an alias for the `ls` command, which is a shortcut that can be used to run the command. For example, a pirate could type `ls` instead of `ls --color=auto`.

### Cron

[Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, cron is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to schedule tasks to be automatically executed at a specific time or interval. This can be useful for tasks that need to be run regularly, such as backing up important documents or cleaning up temporary files.

Cron uses a configuration file called the `crontab` to specify the tasks that it should execute. Each line in the crontab file represents a single task, and consists of six fields separated by spaces:

Minute (0-59)
Hour (0-23)
Day of the month (1-31)
Month of the year (1-12)
Day of the week (0-6, with 0 representing Sunday)
Command to execute
For example, to schedule a task to be executed every day at midnight, a pirate might add the following line to their crontab file:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/task
```

To edit the crontab file, a pirate can use the `crontab -e` command. This will open the file in a text editor, where they can add, modify, or delete tasks as needed.

It's important to note that cron tasks are executed with the permissions of the user who owns the crontab file, so it's important to make sure that the tasks have the necessary permissions to run correctly.

I hope this helps you understand how cron works and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks on their Linux system. Arrr!

### cURL

cURL be a command line tool for transferring data using various network protocols. It be a powerful tool that be widely used by systems administrators and developers for a variety of tasks, such as testing APIs, downloading files, and more. Here be some basics ye should know to use cURL:

Syntax: The basic syntax for using cURL be `curl [options] [URL]`. Ye can specify various options to control how cURL be behavior, and then specify the URL of the resource ye be requesting.

Protocols: cURL support a wide range of network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, and more. Ye can specify the protocol ye be using by including it in the URL, or ye can use the -P option to specify the protocol.

HTTP methods: cURL support all of the HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. Ye can use the `-X` option to specify the method ye be using.

Request headers: cURL allow ye to specify custom request headers to be sent with yer request. Ye can use the `-H` option to specify a header, such as `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` to specify the content type of yer request.

Request data: cURL allow ye to specify data to be sent with yer request, such as form data or a JSON payload. Ye can use the -d option to specify the data ye be sending.

> **Note** If ye be sending JSON data, ye should use the `--data-raw` option instead of the `-d` option. The `-d` option will escape the JSON payload, which will cause the request to fail.

Response headers: cURL allow ye to view the response headers that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-i` option to view the response headers.

Response body: cURL allow ye to view the response body that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-o` option to save the response body to a file, or ye can use the `-O` option to save the response body to a file with the same name as the file on the server.

I hope this helps you understand how cURL works and how a pirate might use it to make HTTP requests. Arrr!

> **Note** if ye ever get stuck use `curl cht.sh/:help` to get help

A typical cURL `GET` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

A typical cURL `POST` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

### Vim

Vim be a text editor that be widely used by developers and systems administrators for editing files in the command line. It be a powerful tool that be highly customizable, and it be known for its steep learning curve. Here be some things ye should know to use Vim effectively:

Modes: Vim be operated in different modes, including normal mode, insert mode, and command mode. Ye'll need to understand these modes and how to switch between them in order to effectively use Vim.

Movement: In normal mode, ye can use movement commands to navigate around yer document. These include commands like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move left, down, up, and right, respectively.

Editing: In insert mode, ye can enter text and make changes to yer document. To enter insert mode, ye can use the `i` command.

Saving and quitting: To save yer changes and quit Vim, ye can use the :wq command in command mode. To save yer changes and continue editing, ye can use the :w command. To quit without saving, ye can use the `:q!` command.

Customization: Vim be highly customizable, and ye can configure it to suit yer needs and preferences. Ye can customize Vim by editing the .vimrc configuration file or by using Lua to create custom plugins.

#### .vimrc

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.vimrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user starts Vim. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.vimrc` file can be used to customize a user's Vim environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.vimrc` file might look like this:

```vim
" Set the color scheme to material
colorscheme material

" Enable syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Enable line numbers
set number

" Enable relative line numbers
set relativenumber

" Enable auto-indenting
set autoindent

" Enable smart indenting
set smartindent

" Enable line wrapping
set wrap

" Enable spell checking
set spell

" Enable spell checking for comments
set spelllang=en_us
```

### The Internet

The internet be a global network of interconnected computer networks that be used to share information and resources. It be a vast network that be made up of millions of computers, servers, and other devices that be connected together using a variety of technologies and protocols. The internet be used by people all over the world to communicate, access information, and perform a wide range of tasks.

In simpler terms, ye can think of the internet as a vast ocean of data and information that be accessible from anywhere in the world. Just like a ship be able to sail the oceans and explore new lands, ye can use the internet to explore a vast world of information and resources.

So hoist the mainsail and set course for the internet! With the internet at yer fingertips, ye'll be able to explore a vast and ever-expanding world of information and resources. Arrrr!

#### Web Browser

A web browser be a software application that be used to access and view web resources. It be a powerful tool that be used by billions of people every day to access information, communicate, and perform a wide range of tasks.

In a pirate theme, ye can think of a web browser as a ship that be used to explore the internet. Just like a ship be able to sail the oceans and explore new lands, a web browser be able to explore a vast world of information and resources.

Today, there be a wide variety of web browsers available, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. Each browser be different, and they be optimized for different platforms and use cases. For example, Google Chrome be optimized for speed and performance, while Mozilla Firefox be optimized for customization and extensibility.

So hoist the mainsail and set course for the internet! With a web browser at yer fingertips, ye'll be able to explore a vast and ever-expanding world of information and resources. Arrrr!

#### World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW) be a system of interlinked hypertext documents that be accessed via the internet. It be a vast collection of resources that be accessible from anywhere in the world, and it be used by billions of people every day to access information, communicate, and perform a wide range of tasks.

In a pirate theme, ye can think of the World Wide Web as a vast ocean of information and resources that be accessible from anywhere in the world. Just like a ship be able to sail the oceans and explore new lands, ye can use the World Wide Web to explore a vast world of information and resources.

The creators of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau, be inspired by the concept of a hypertext system that be accessible from anywhere in the world. They be envisionin' a system that be accessible from anywhere in the world, and they be inspired by the concept of a hypertext system that be accessible from anywhere in the world.

So hoist the mainsail and set course for the World Wide Web! With the World Wide Web at yer fingertips, ye'll be able to explore a vast and ever-expanding world of information and resources. Arrrr!

#### Web Server

A web server be a computer that be used to host web resources, such as web pages, images, and videos. It be a powerful tool that be used by billions of people every day to access information, communicate, and perform a wide range of tasks.

##### Sir Tim Berners-Lee

![Sir Tim Berners-Lee](images/timbernerslee.jpg)

Sir Tim Berners-Lee be a British computer scientist and engineer who be best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He be a pioneer in the field of computer science, and he be the founder of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which be a standards organization that be responsible for the development of web standards.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. It allows for faster and more frequent updates to a software application, as code changes can be automatically deployed as soon as they pass testing. This can help to reduce the risk of deployments, as well as speed up the time it takes for new features or bug fixes to reach users.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous delivery as a way to quickly and efficiently get your ship (the software application) ready for battle. Instead of spending a lot of time preparing and repairing the ship before each voyage (deployment), continuous delivery allows you to make small, incremental changes to the ship as needed, so that it is always ready to set sail. This way, you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) and be better prepared for whatever the seas (your users) might throw your way.

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly integrate their code changes into a shared repository, typically several times a day. Each integration is then automatically built and tested to ensure that the code changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.

In a pirate theme, you could think of continuous integration as a way to keep your ship (the software application) in good repair. Instead of waiting until the end of a long voyage to fix any problems with the ship, continuous integration allows you to make small repairs and improvements as you go. By regularly integrating and testing code changes, you can catch and fix problems early, before they become bigger issues that could sink the ship. This helps to ensure that your ship is always ready to set sail, and that you can respond more quickly to new threats (bug fixes and feature requests) as they arise.

### eBPF

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a technology that allows for the dynamic insertion of BPF programs into the Linux kernel at various hook points. It allows for the creation of powerful, flexible, and efficient tracing and monitoring tools, as well as the ability to write custom kernel modules without having to write any C code.

In a pirate theme, you could think of eBPF as a way to add new features to your ship (the Linux kernel). Instead of having to modify the ship's hull (the Linux kernel) to add new features, eBPF allows you to add new features by inserting new code into the ship's hull (the Linux kernel). This allows you to add new features without having to modify the ship's hull, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

### DNS (Domain Name System)

In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that maps human-readable domain names (such as "example.com") to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS helps to make it easier for people to access websites and other online resources, as it allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of having to remember complex numerical addresses.

In a pirate theme, you could think of DNS as a way to navigate the vast and often-treacherous seas of the internet. Just as a map helps a pirate to find their way from one island to another, DNS helps to guide internet users to the websites and online resources they are looking for. Instead of having to remember the exact location of each island (website), a pirate can simply consult their map (DNS) to find the right route.

DNS also helps to ensure that internet users can reach their destination even if the underlying landscape (IP addresses) changes. Just as a pirate might need to adjust their course if the winds or currents shift, DNS can automatically route internet users to the correct location even if the underlying IP addresses change. This helps to make the internet more reliable and accessible, even in the midst of constantly-changing conditions.

#### Types of DNS Records

There are several different types of DNS records that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. The most common types of DNS records are A records, which map a domain name to a single IP address, and CNAME records, which map a domain name to another domain name. Other types of DNS records include MX records, which map a domain name to an email server, and TXT records, which can be used to store arbitrary text data.

### Docker

Arr matey, ye be askin' about Docker, the popular containerization software that be makin' it easier to ship, run, and manage applications.

Docker be usin' containers to package up an application with all of the parts it be needin' to run, such as libraries and dependencies, and ship it as one package. This be makin' it easier to run the application on any other machine, regardless of the specific environment or configuration.

To work with Docker, ye might be usin' the Docker Engine to build, run, and manage containers. Ye can build your own containers or use ones that other scallywags have built and shared. Ye can also use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications, makin' it easier to scale and manage them.

In terms of practical use, ye might be usin' Docker to set up a development environment for your application, or to package and deploy your application to production. Ye can also use Docker to run databases or other services that your application relies on.

So there ye have it, a brief overview of Docker and how ye might be workin' with it. I hope this be helpin' ye to understand this powerful tool for managing and running applications. Shiver me timbers!

#### Install Docker

To install Docker, ye can follow the instructions on the Docker website. Ye can also use the Docker Toolbox to install Docker on Windows and Mac.

##### Docker Engine

Docker Engine be a client-server application that be used to build, run, and manage Docker containers. The Docker Engine be made up of two parts: the Docker daemon and the Docker client.

The Docker daemon be a background service that be runnin' on yer computer. It be responsible for building, runnin', and distributing yer Docker containers. The Docker client be the command line tool that ye use to interact with the Docker daemon.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```

Once Docker be installed, ye can verify that it be workin' by runnin' the docker version command in a terminal window.

#### Docker Compose

Docker Compose be a tool for defining and runnin' multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, ye can use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, ye can create and start all the services from yer configuration.

##### Install Docker Compose

To install Docker Compose, ye can follow the instructions on the Docker Compose website. Ye can also use the Docker Toolbox to install Docker Compose on Windows and Mac.

```bash
COMPOSE_VERSION=`git ls-remote https://github.com/docker/compose | grep refs/tags | grep -oE "[0-9]+\.[0-9][0-9]+\.[0-9]+$" | sort --version-sort | tail -n 1`
sudo sh -c "curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose"

Docker Swarm be a native clustering tool for Docker. It be used to deploy and manage a cluster of Docker Engines.

### Git

Git be a free and open-source version control system that be used by developers to track changes to their code and collaborate with other developers on software projects. It be a way to keep a record of the history of a project, so ye can go back and see what be changed and when.

Git be a distributed version control system, which means that each copy of the code be a complete repository of the project, with all its history. This be different from a centralized version control system, where ye have a single "master" copy of the code that everyone else be working off of.

To use Git, ye first need to install it on yer computer. Then, ye can create a new repository for a project by running the git init command in a terminal window. Ye can then add files to the repository and commit those changes to the repository's history, using the git add and git commit commands.

Git be a powerful tool that be widely used by developers around the world, and it be particularly useful for working on large, complex software projects with multiple contributors. I hope this helps ye understand what Git be and how it can be used!

#### GitHub

GitHub be a web-based platform that be used by developers to host and share their code repositories, as well as collaborate with other developers on software projects. It be built on top of Git, the version control system that I described in me previous message.

GitHub be a great place for developers to store their code and track changes to it over time. It be also a great place to share code with other developers and collaborate on projects together. Ye can use GitHub to create new repositories for yer own projects, or ye can contribute to other people's projects by forking their repositories and submitting pull requests.

GitHub be a valuable resource for developers, as it be a place to find and share code, as well as collaborate with other developers on projects. It be also a great place to find open-source projects and contribute to them. I hope this helps ye understand what GitHub be and how it can be used by developers!

### Homebrew

Homebrew is a free and open-source package management system for macOS and Linux that simplifies the installation of software on those operating systems. It allows users to install and manage software packages written in a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Go, as well as libraries and other dependencies needed to run those programs.

Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew that is designed to run on Linux systems. It provides the same functionality as Homebrew, but is specifically tailored for use on Linux systems. It is written in Ruby and can be used to install and manage software packages on a wide range of Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora.

To install Homebrew on macOS, you can open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

To install Linuxbrew on a Linux system, you can run the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Both Homebrew and Linuxbrew use a command-line interface to install and manage packages. Once installed, you can use the brew command to search for and install packages, as well as manage and update the packages you have installed.

For example, to search for a package called "treasuremap," you can run the following command:

```bash
brew search treasuremap
```

To install a package called "treasuremap," you can run the following command:

```bash
brew install treasuremap
```

### HTML

Ahoy matey! HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a standardized system for marking up text files to indicate how they should be displayed in a web browser. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, HTML helps web browsers interpret and display the content of a web page.

HTML uses a set of predefined tags to structure and format the content of a web page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are used to mark the beginning and end of an element. For example, the "p" tag is used to define a paragraph, and the "h1" tag is used to define a level 1 heading.

Here's an example of some basic HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Pirate's Cove</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Pirate's Cove</h1>
    <p>Ahoy matey! Welcome to the finest pirate's hideout on the internet.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This code defines a simple web page with a level 1 heading and a paragraph of text. The "html" tag indicates the start and end of the HTML document, the "head" tag contains information about the document, and the "body" tag contains the visible content of the page.

HTML is just one part of the puzzle when it comes to building a website. Other technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, are often used in conjunction with HTML to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.

I hope this helps you understand what HTML is and how a pirate might use it to build their own website. Arrr!

#### CSS

Ahoy matey! CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, CSS helps web browsers interpret and display the content of a web page in a specific way.

CSS uses a set of rules, called "styles", to define the appearance of the elements on a web page. These styles can be applied to specific elements on the page, or to groups of elements using selectors.

Here's an example of some basic CSS code:

```css
body {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #ffffff;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #ff0000;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

This code defines the styles for the `body`, `h1`, and `p` elements on a web page. The `body` style sets the background color to `black`, the text color to `white`, and the font family to `sans-serif`. The `h1` style sets the text color to `red`, and the `p` style sets the font size to `16` pixels and the line height to `1.5`.

CSS can be used to style a wide variety of elements on a web page, including text, images, and layout. It can also be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

I hope this helps you understand what CSS is and how a pirate might use it to style their website. Arrr!

### HTTP

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data on the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to transfer data from a server to a client, or vice versa.

In a pirate theme, you could think of HTTP as the system that allows pirates to send and receive messages and information as they sail the seas of the internet. Just like a pirate ship uses a flag to communicate with other ships, a website uses HTTP to communicate with a client's web browser. When you enter a website's address into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which includes the content of the website.

HTTP is just one of many protocols that make the internet work, but it is an important one because it allows us to access and interact with websites and other online resources. Arrr!

### HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) can be thought of as a way to secure communication between two parties. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet, and it is designed to provide an additional layer of security on top of the regular HTTP protocol.

Imagine that two pirates are trying to send messages to each other over the internet, but they are worried that their messages might be intercepted by other pirates or other parties. To secure their communication, they could use HTTPS. When they use HTTPS, their messages are encrypted, which means that they are transformed into a code that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient. This makes it much harder for anyone else to intercept and read the messages, as they would need to have the key to decrypt the code.

In addition to encryption, HTTPS also provides authentication, which means that it can verify the identity of the sender and the recipient. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third party tries to intercept and manipulate the communication between two parties.

Overall, HTTPS is a useful tool for pirates (or anyone else) who want to keep their communication private and secure. It can help protect against interception and tampering, and it can also provide reassurance that the messages are actually coming from the intended sender.

### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) can be thought of as a communication protocol that is used to transmit messages between devices on a network. It is often used to send error messages or to request information from other devices.

On a Linux system, ICMP is used for a variety of purposes, including:

Error reporting: ICMP can be used to send error messages when there is a problem with a network connection or when a packet of data cannot be delivered.

Network diagnosis: ICMP can be used to request information from other devices on the network, such as the round-trip time of a packet or the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a link. This can be useful for diagnosing network problems and optimizing network performance.

Network discovery: ICMP can be used to send "ping" messages, which are used to determine if a device is reachable on the network. This can be useful for detecting network outages or for verifying network connectivity.

You might imagine that ICMP is a useful tool for pirates to keep track of their network and diagnose problems. It allows them to communicate with other devices on the network and request information that can help them understand how the network is functioning.

An example of troubleshooting a network problem using ICMP might look like this:

1. A pirate sends a ping message to a device on the network.
2. The device responds with an ICMP echo reply message.
3. The pirate receives the echo reply message and uses it to determine the round-trip time of the packet.
4. The pirate uses the round-trip time to diagnose the problem and determine the cause of the network outage.
5. The pirate fixes the problem and the network is restored.
6. The pirate sends another ping message to the device to verify that the network is working again.
7. The device responds with an ICMP echo reply message.

### Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a way to define and manage your infrastructure and its dependencies using code, rather than manually configuring resources through a graphical user interface. This allows you to version control your infrastructure, automate the provisioning and management of resources, and apply testing and deployment practices similar to those used in software development.

In a pirate theme, you could think of infrastructure as code as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships and their various systems and equipment. Instead of manually configuring and repairing each ship's sails, masts, and engines, you could use code to define how these components should be set up and configured. This would allow you to automate the process of building and repairing your ships, as well as make it easier to scale your fleet as needed.

By using infrastructure as code, you can also more easily track and manage changes to your ships' systems and equipment over time, as well as roll back any changes that might cause problems. This can help you to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

#### Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool that can be used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. It can be used to automate the configuration of servers, networks, and other infrastructure components, and it can also be used to automate the deployment of applications.

In a pirate theme, you could think of Ansible as a tool that can be used to automate the provisioning and management of a fleet of ships. It can be used to automate the configuration of a ship's sails, masts, and engines, as well as the deployment of new cannons and other equipment.

Ansible can be used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, including:

Servers: Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of servers, including installing software, configuring services, and managing users and groups.

Networks: Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of networks, including configuring switches, routers, and firewalls.

Cloud: Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of cloud infrastructure, including configuring virtual machines, load balancers, and storage.

Containers: Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of containers, including configuring Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.

You might imagine that Ansible is a useful tool for pirates to automate the provisioning and management of their fleet of ships. It can be used to automate the configuration of a ship's sails, masts, and engines, as well as the deployment of new cannons and other equipment.

##### Install Ansible

Ansible can be installed on a Linux system using the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Ansible using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ansible -y
```

#### Terraform

Terraform is a tool that can be used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure. It can be used to automate the configuration of servers, networks, and other infrastructure components, and it can also be used to automate the deployment of applications.

In a pirate theme, you could think of Terraform as a tool that can be used to automate the provisioning and management of a fleet of ships. It can be used to automate the configuration of a ship's sails, masts, and engines, as well as the deployment of new cannons and other equipment.

Terraform can be used to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, including:

Servers: Terraform can be used to automate the configuration of servers, including installing software, configuring services, and managing users and groups.

Networks: Terraform can be used to automate the configuration of networks, including configuring switches, routers, and firewalls.

Cloud: Terraform can be used to automate the configuration of cloud infrastructure, including configuring virtual machines, load balancers, and storage.

Containers: Terraform can be used to automate the configuration of containers, including configuring Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.

You might imagine that Terraform is a useful tool for pirates to automate the provisioning and management of their fleet of ships. It can be used to automate the configuration of a ship's sails, masts, and engines, as well as the deployment of new cannons and other equipment.

##### Install Terraform

Terraform can be installed on a Linux system using the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Terraform using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install terraform -y
```

Another option for more advanced users is to use `tfenv` to install Terraform. `tfenv` is a tool that can be used to install and manage multiple versions of Terraform on a single system. It can be installed using the following command:

- Check out tfenv into any path (here is `${HOME}/.tfenv`)

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv.git ~/.tfenv
```

- Add `~/.tfenv/bin` to your `$PATH` any way you like

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.tfenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

On Ubuntu/Debian touching `/usr/local/bin` might require sudo access, but you can create `${HOME}/bin` or `${HOME}/.local/bin` and on next login it will get added to the session `$PATH` or by running `. ${HOME}/.profile` it will get added to the current shell session's `$PATH`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/
. ~/.profile
ln -s ~/.tfenv/bin/* ~/.local/bin
which tfenv
```

### IP Addresses

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) can be thought of as a unique identifier that is assigned to each device that is connected to the internet. It is a numerical label that is used to identify a specific device, and it is similar to a physical address or a phone number.

Imagine that a group of pirates are all connected to the same network, and they want to communicate with each other over the internet. In order to send messages to a specific pirate, they need to know the pirate's IP address. Just like how a physical address tells you where a house is located, an IP address tells you where a device is located on the internet.

IP addresses are usually assigned by internet service providers (ISPs) or network administrators, and they can be either static (meaning they never change) or dynamic (meaning they are assigned temporarily and can change over time).

You might imagine that each pirate has a unique IP address that they use to communicate with other pirates over the internet. They might also use IP addresses to access websites and other online resources, just like how people use IP addresses in the real world.

#### What is an IP made up of?

Ahoy matey! An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Just like how a pirate might use a map to navigate through the open seas, an IP address helps devices on a network find and communicate with each other.

An IP address consists of four numbers separated by periods, and each number can range from 0 to 255. For example, an IP address might look like this: 192.168.1.1

These four numbers represent different parts of the IP address, known as octets. Each octet is a group of 8 bits, and together, the four octets make up a 32-bit number.

The first octet is used to identify the network that the device is a part of. The remaining three octets are used to identify the specific device within that network.

There are two main versions of IP addresses in use today: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the most widely used version and uses 32-bit numbers, as described above. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit numbers and allows for a much larger number of unique IP addresses.

To understand an IP address, it's important to know the difference between a public and a private IP address. A public IP address is a unique address that is assigned to a device by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is used to identify the device on the Internet. A private IP address, on the other hand, is used to identify devices within a private network, such as a home or office network. Private IP addresses are not unique and are usually assigned by the router on the network.

I hope this helps you understand how IP addresses work and how a pirate might use them to navigate the vast ocean of the Internet. Arrr!

### JavaScript

Ahoy matey! Are ye interested in learning about JavaScript, the programming language used to make websites and web applications more interactive and dynamic?

JavaScript is a popular, cross-platform programming language that is primarily used to create dynamic and interactive elements on websites. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript is often used in combination with these other technologies to build complex web applications and sites.

JavaScript code is usually written in text editors and then run in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. The code can be written directly in an HTML file, or it can be linked to an external JavaScript file that is then referenced in the HTML file.

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which is the structure of a website's HTML and CSS. This allows JavaScript to modify the appearance and content of a website in real-time, as well as respond to user input and interactivity.

JavaScript is also an object-oriented programming language, meaning that it is based on the concept of "objects" that have properties and methods. These objects can be used to represent real-world concepts, such as a person or a car, and can be manipulated and controlled using the JavaScript language.

I hope that helps ye get a better understanding of JavaScript, matey! If ye have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.

### JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure, their crew, and their adventures on the high seas.

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that is used to transmit data between a server and a client, or between different systems. It is based on the JavaScript programming language, but can be used with many other programming languages as well.

JSON is a popular choice for storing and exchanging data because it is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for computers to parse and generate. It is often used to send data from a server to a web page, or to store data in a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB.

To use JSON, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on key-value pairs and lists of values. A key-value pair consists of a unique key and a value, separated by a colon. A list of values is an ordered collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

JSON is a powerful and flexible tool that is widely used in modern web development, and is an important part of a pirate's arsenal. Arrr!

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes (also known as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps to provide a consistent and reliable environment for running applications, regardless of where they are deployed.

In a pirate theme, you could think of Kubernetes as a way to manage and maintain your fleet of ships (the containerized applications). Instead of having to manually deploy and manage each ship individually, Kubernetes allows you to automate the process and scale your fleet as needed. This can help you to be more efficient and responsive, as you can deploy new ships or make changes to existing ones more quickly and easily.

Kubernetes also helps to ensure that your ships are running smoothly and reliably, by providing features like automatic self-healing, rolling updates, and resource management. This can help to keep your fleet seaworthy and ready to set sail at a moment's notice, no matter where you are in the world.

### Latency

Latency is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another. In a pirate theme, you could think of latency as the time it takes for a message to travel from one pirate to another.

Latency is an important concept in computer networking, and it is often used to describe the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from one device to another. Latency is measured in milliseconds (ms), and it is usually measured using a tool called a ping.

Latency is an important metric to consider when designing a network, as it can affect the performance of applications and services. For example, if a user is experiencing high latency, they may experience slow loading times or poor video quality when streaming a video.

Latency can also be affected by the distance between two devices, as well as the type of network connection that is being used. For example, a wireless connection will typically have higher latency than a wired connection.

### Logging

Logging on a Linux system can be thought of as a way for pirates to keep track of what is happening on their network. Logging is the process of recording events and activities that occur on a computer system, and it is a useful tool for diagnosing problems, tracking changes, and detecting security breaches.

On a Linux system, logging is typically managed by a program called syslog. Syslog is a system daemon that collects and stores log messages from various sources, such as the operating system, applications, and network devices. The syslog daemon writes the log messages to a file or sends them to a remote server, where they can be accessed and analyzed by the pirates.

There are several different types of log messages that can be recorded on a Linux system, including system logs, application logs, and security logs. System logs contain information about the operating system and system-level events, such as system startup and shutdown, kernel messages, and system errors. Application logs contain information about specific applications and their activities, such as user actions and error messages. Security logs contain information about security-related events, such as failed login attempts and system access.

Logging can be a useful tool for pirates to monitor their network and keep track of what is happening on their systems. It can help them identify problems, track changes, and detect security breaches, all of which are important for keeping their network running smoothly and securely.

### Monitoring

Monitoring on a Linux system can be thought of as a way for pirates to keep track of the performance and status of their systems. Monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data about a system's resources and activities, and it is a useful tool for identifying problems, optimizing performance, and detecting security breaches.

There are many different tools and techniques that can be used to monitor a Linux system, including:

System logs: Pirates can use system logs to keep track of events and activities that occur on their system. System logs contain information about the operating system, applications, and network devices, and they can be used to identify problems, track changes, and detect security breaches.

System utilities: Pirates can use system utilities such as top, ps, and free to monitor the performance of their system in real-time. These utilities can provide information about the CPU, memory, and disk usage of their system, as well as the processes that are running.

Network monitoring: Pirates can use tools such as netstat and tcpdump to monitor the network traffic on their system. These tools can provide information about the packets that are being transmitted and received, as well as the status of network connections.

Monitoring can be a useful tool for pirates to keep their systems running smoothly and securely. It allows them to identify problems, optimize performance, and detect security breaches, all of which are important for maintaining a healthy and efficient network.

### OSI model

The OSI model be a framework fer understanding and designing how data be transmitted over yer network. It be made up of seven layers, each representing a different aspect of networking:

`Physical layer`: This layer be responsible fer the physical connections and devices that be used fer transmitting data over yer network. Examples include cables, switches, and routers.

`Data link layer`: This layer be responsible fer establishing and maintaining a connection between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as error detection and correction, and fer providing flow control to prevent data overload.

`Network layer`: This layer be responsible fer routing data between devices on yer network. It be using addresses to determine the best path fer data to travel, and be responsible fer tasks such as packet switching and traffic control.

`Transport layer`: This layer be responsible fer ensuring that data be delivered reliably and efficiently between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as segmentation, reassembly, and flow control.

`Session layer`: This layer be responsible fer establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as establishing a session, coordinating communication, and recovering from errors.

`Presentation layer`: This layer be responsible fer translating data between devices on yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as encoding, decoding, and compression.

`Application layer`: This layer be responsible fer providing services to applications that be using yer network. It be responsible fer tasks such as messaging, file transfer, and network management.

The OSI model be a useful tool fer understanding and designing the communication systems on yer network. It provides a framework fer understanding the different layers of networking, and fer identifying the tasks and responsibilities that be associated with each layer.

### SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secret code that allows pirates to remotely control their ships and protect their communications from prying eyes.

SSH is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer over an unsecured network, such as the internet. It is often used to remotely access and control servers, but it can also be used to securely transfer files and perform other tasks.

To use SSH, you need an SSH client, which is a program that connects to an SSH server. When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

#### SSH Keys

SSH keys are a type of secret code that can be used to authenticate a user when connecting to an SSH server. SSH keys are a more secure alternative to passwords, as they are much harder to guess or brute force.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. If you provide a private key, the SSH server will use the corresponding public key to authenticate you. If the public key matches the private key, you will be granted access to the server.

SSH keys are widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. They are a more secure alternative to passwords, and are an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

#### SSH Port Forwarding

SSH port forwarding is a feature that allows you to forward traffic from a local port to a remote port on an SSH server. This can be useful for accessing services that are only available on a remote server, such as a web server or database.

When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH port forwarding is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

### SSL Certificates

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates be a type of digital certificate that be used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a client, such as a web browser. This be makin' it more difficult for third parties to intercept or tamper with the communication between the server and client.

When a client, such as a web browser, connects to a server that be usin' an SSL certificate, the server will present the certificate to the client. The client will then verify the certificate, and if it be valid, the two will establish an encrypted connection.

In the context of nginx, ye might be usin' an SSL certificate to secure the connection between nginx and the clients that be connectin' to it, such as web browsers. To do this, ye will need to obtain an SSL certificate and configure nginx to use it.

There be a few different types of SSL certificates, each with its own level of validation and security. Some be more expensive and time-consuming to obtain, but offer a higher level of trust and security.

I hope this be helpin' ye to understand how SSL certificates be workin' and how ye might be usin' them with nginx. Ahoy!

#### Let's Encrypt

Let's Encrypt be a free, automated, and open certificate authority (CA) that be usin' SSL certificates to secure websites and other online services. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

Certbot be a free, open-source tool that be usin' Let's Encrypt to obtain and install SSL certificates. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) be a non-profit organization that be workin' to protect and advance digital rights. It be makin' it easier fer people to obtain and install SSL certificates, and be helpin' to increase the security of the internet.

### Streaming

You could think of streaming as a way for pirates to continuously receive updates and information from other ships as they sail the seas of the internet.

In software engineering, streaming refers to the process of continuously transmitting data from a server to a client, or vice versa, without the need to download and save the entire dataset upfront. This allows the client to receive and process the data as it is being transmitted, rather than waiting for the entire dataset to be transferred before beginning to process it.

Streaming is commonly used for media, such as music and video, but it can also be used for other types of data, such as financial data or social media updates. It allows users to access and process large amounts of data in real-time, rather than having to wait for it to be transferred and stored locally.

Streaming can be implemented using a variety of technologies and protocols, such as HTTP streaming, WebSockets, and WebRTC. It is an important part of modern software engineering, and is a valuable tool for pirates as they navigate the choppy waters of the internet. Arrr!

### Subnet

A subnet (short for "subnetwork") can be thought of as a smaller network that is contained within a larger network. It is a way to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable parts.

Imagine that a group of pirates have set up a network to communicate with each other over the internet. The network might be very large, with many different pirates and devices connected to it. To make it easier to manage and organize the network, the pirates might decide to create subnets.

For example, they might create a subnet for pirates who are located in the same geographical area, or they might create a subnet for pirates who are working on the same project. This would allow them to easily communicate with each other and share resources, while also keeping their communication separate from other parts of the network.

In a real-world context, subnets are often used to improve the efficiency of networks by reducing the amount of traffic that needs to be routed between different parts of the network. They can also be used to improve security by isolating different parts of the network from each other.

#### Subnet mask

A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. It is used in conjunction with an IP address to determine which devices are part of the same subnet.

Imagine that a group of pirates are using subnets to divide their network into smaller, more manageable parts. Each pirate has an IP address that is assigned to their device, and the subnet mask is used to identify which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host.

For example, if the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", it means that the first three octets (groups of 8 bits) of the IP address represent the network portion, while the last octet represents the host portion. Using this information, the pirates can determine which devices are part of the same subnet and can communicate with each other directly, without having to go through a router.

In the real-world, subnet masks are used to divide networks into smaller, more manageable parts and to improve the efficiency of communication between devices on a network. They are an important part of the IP addressing system, and they are used in many different types of networks, including pirate networks.

#### How to calculate a subnet mask

Determine the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create. Consider factors such as the number of pirates and devices that will be connected to the network, the geographical location of the pirates, and the types of resources that will be shared on the network.

Select a subnet mask that is appropriate for your network. A subnet mask is a string of numbers that is used to identify which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. The subnet mask will depend on the size of your network and the number of subnets you want to create.

Calculate the subnet address for each subnet. To do this, you will need to use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device on the network. The subnet address is the portion of the IP address that belongs to the network, as identified by the subnet mask.

Assign an IP address to each device on the network. The IP address should be unique for each device, and it should include the subnet address for the subnet that the device is part of.

For example, let's say that you have a network with 100 pirates, and you want to create 10 subnets with 10 pirates each. You might select a subnet mask of "255.255.255.0", which would allow you to create up to 256 subnets. To calculate the subnet address for each subnet, you would use the subnet mask and the IP address of each device. For example, if the IP address of a device is "192.168.1.1", and the subnet mask is "255.255.255.0", the subnet address would be "192.168.1.0".

### TCP/IP

TCP/IP be a suite of networking protocols that be used to connect devices on the internet. It be the foundation of the internet, and it be what allow devices to communicate with each other and exchange data over the network.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) be a protocol that be used to establish and maintain connections between devices on the network. It be responsible for dividing data into smaller packets and sending them over the network, and it be also responsible for ensuring that the packets be delivered to the destination reliably.

IP (Internet Protocol) be a protocol that be used to route packets of data between devices on the network. It be responsible for assigning unique addresses to devices on the network and routing packets to the correct destination based on these addresses.

Together, TCP and IP be the backbone of the internet, and they be what allow devices to communicate and exchange data with each other. So hoist the mainsail and set course for TCP/IP mastery! With a solid understanding of these protocols, ye'll be well on yer way to becoming a skilled network administrator. Arrrr!

### UDP

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a communication protocol that is used to transmit data over networks, such as the internet. It is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than protocols that require a connection to be established, but it also means that data transmitted using UDP is less reliable, as there is no guarantee that the data will be received by the intended recipient.

You might imagine UDP as a way for pirates to send messages to each other without having to go through the trouble of setting up a formal communication channel. They could simply send a message using UDP and hope that it gets to the intended recipient, much like a pirate sending a message in a bottle and hoping it reaches its destination.

### YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure maps and their plans for future raids.

In software engineering and devops, YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files and in applications that need to process data from multiple sources. It is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and is often used as an alternative to XML or JSON.

To use YAML, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on indentation and key-value pairs. A key-value pair consists of a unique key, followed by a colon, followed by the value. Indentation is used to indicate the hierarchy of the data, with each level of indentation representing a new level in the hierarchy.

YAML is a popular choice for configuration files because it is easy to read and write, and it is flexible enough to support a wide variety of data structures. It is also often used in devops tools, such as Ansible and Docker, to define infrastructure as code.

To use YAML effectively as a pirate, you should familiarize yourself with its syntax and conventions, and understand how it is used in the tools and technologies you are working with. Arrr!

### Zsh

Arrr matey! Zsh, also known as the "Z shell," is a Unix shell and command-line interpreter that you can use on your Linux system. It's similar to other shells like the Bourne shell (sh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash), but it offers additional features and functionality that can make it easier and more efficient to use.

To get started with zsh on your Linux system, you'll need to install it first. You can do this using your system's package manager, such as "apt" on Debian-based systems or "yum" on Red Hat-based systems. For example, you might run a command like this:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh -y
```

Once zsh is installed, you can start using it by launching a terminal window and entering `zsh` at the command prompt. This will launch the zsh shell, and you can start entering commands just like you would with any other shell.

You can also set zsh as your default shell, so that it will be launched automatically whenever you open a terminal window. To do this, you'll need to use the `chsh` command and specify the path to the zsh executable. For example:

```bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

I hope this helps get you started with zsh on your Linux system, matey! Let me know if you have any other questions.

#### Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh is a popular open-source project that helps users configure and customize the Z shell (zsh). It provides a variety of themes, plugins, and features that can make it easier to use zsh and add additional functionality to your terminal.

To use Oh My Zsh, you'll need to install it on your system. You can do this by following the instructions:

- Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

## Chapter Three: Your first day as a pirate

We are going to get a little bit hands on here. We are going to create a new project and we are going to create a new file. We are going to call this file `index.html`. We are going to open this file in our text editor. We are going to add some HTML to this file. We are going to save this file. We are going to open this file in our browser. We are going to see the result of our work. We are going to be very happy. We are going to celebrate. We are going to go to the pub. We are going to have a drink. We are going to have a good time. We are going to be pirates.

Just kidding. Although that is a great way to start, we should do a little bit more than that.

1. **Setting Sail:** It be time to set sail! In the terminal, try using the `ls` command to list the files and directories in the current directory, and the `cd` command to navigate to different directories. Can ye find yer way to the ship's hold?

2. **Finding Yer Way Home:** After a long voyage, it be nice to have a place to call home. In the terminal, try using the `echo` command to print out yer home directory, and the `cd` command to navigate to it. Can ye find a way to create a new directory and move a file into it?

3. **Managing Yer Crew:** A good captain be able to manage their crew and keep track of who be on board. In the terminal, try using the `whoami` command to see what user ye be logged in as, and the `groups` command to see what groups ye be a member of. Can ye find out who else be on board the ship?

4. **Navigating the Seas:** No voyage be complete without a good map! In the terminal, try using the `man` command to read the documentation for different commands and learn how to use them. Can ye find out how to use the `grep` command to search for a specific word in a file?

5. **Arranging Yer Crew:** A captain be nothing without a well-organized crew. In the terminal, try using the `sort` command to sort a list of names, and the `uniq` command to remove duplicates. Can ye find a way to count the number of unique names in the list?

6. **Setting Up Anchor:** When it be time to rest, ye need to know how to set anchor. In the terminal, try using the `touch` command to create a new file, and the `rm` command to delete a file. Can ye find a way to rename a file?

7. **Sending Messages in a Bottle:** When ye be out at sea, ye need to find ways to communicate with the rest of the world. In the terminal, try using the `mail` command to send a message to yerself or another user on the ship. Can ye find out how to attach a file to the message?

8. **Finding Yer Way Around the Ship:** The first thing ye need to do is get yer bearings and learn how to navigate around the ship. In the terminal, try using the `pwd` command to see what directory ye be in, and the `ls` command to see what files and directories be in that directory. Can ye find yer way to the main deck?

9. **Raising the Anchor:** When it be time to set sail again, ye need to know how to raise anchor. In the terminal, try using the `chmod` command to change the permissions on a file or directory, and the `chown` command to change the owner of a file or directory. Can ye find a way to change the group ownership of a file or directory?

10. **Sending Signals:** When ye need to get someone's attention, ye need to know how to send a signal. In the terminal, try using the `kill` command to send a signal to a running process, and the `ps` command to list the processes running on the ship. Can ye find a way to stop a process from running?

### Common problems

Here are a few examples of common problems you might face when working with Linux, along with some possible solutions in a pirate theme:

1. **The Ship Be Sinking!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "out of memory." This be a problem because yer ship doesn't have enough memory to run all the programs ye be trying to use. To fix this problem, ye can try closing some programs or processes that be using a lot of memory, or ye can try adding more memory to yer ship.

2. **The Ship Be Adrift!:** Ye be trying to run a program, but ye keep getting a message saying "command not found." This be a problem because yer ship doesn't know where to find the program ye be trying to run. To fix this problem, ye can try using the which command to see where the program be installed, or ye can try adding the directory where the program be installed to yer PATH environment variable.

3. **The Ship Be Under Attack!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "permission denied." This be a problem because yer ship be trying to access a file or directory that ye don't have permission to access. To fix this problem, ye can try using the chmod command to change the permissions on the file or directory, or ye can try using the sudo command to run the program as the superuser.

4. **The Ship Be Taking on Water!:** Ye be working on yer code, when all of a sudden ye see a message saying "disk full." This be a problem because yer ship's hard drive be full and ye don't have any more space to store yer files. To fix this problem, ye can try deleting some files that ye don't need anymore, or ye can try adding a new hard drive to yer ship.

I hope these examples give ye an idea of some common problems ye might face when working with Linux, and how ye might go about solving them.

### Initiation

Ye be now ready to begin yer journey as a Linux pirate! Ye can start by reading the rest of this book, or ye can try some of the challenges below.

#### Question 1: Arrrrrgh

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure firewall on the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Create a new firewall rule that allows incoming traffic on port `80` (HTTP) and port `443` (HTTPS) from the IP address of your pirate ship, and blocks all other incoming traffic.

2. Set up a new user account for the merchant vessel's captain with the username `captain` and the password `treasure`. The captain should have sudo privileges.

3. Set up a cron job that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager. If updates are available, the cron job should automatically install them.

**Answer:**

To create a new firewall rule that allows incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` from the IP address of your pirate ship and blocks all other incoming traffic, you can use the `ufw` utility. First, run the following command to enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Then, run the following command to allow incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` from your pirate ship's IP address:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from <pirate ship IP address> to any port 80,443
```

Finally, run the following command to block all other incoming traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

To set up a new user account for the merchant vessel's captain with the username `captain` and the password `treasure`, and grant them sudo privileges, you can use the useradd and usermod commands. First, run the following command to create the new user account:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash captain
```

This will create a new user account with the username `captain` and a home directory at `/home/captain`. Next, run the following command to set the password for the `captain` user:

```bash
sudo passwd captain
```

Enter `treasure` as the password when prompted. Finally, run the following command to grant the `captain` user sudo privileges:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo captain
```

To set up a cron job that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 * * * * apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

This will run the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade -y` commands every hour. The `apt-get update` command checks for updates to the package manager, and the `apt-get upgrade -y` command installs any available updates.

#### Question 2: The Black Pearl

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure backup system for the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the rsync utility on the merchant vessel's servers.
2. Set up a script that runs daily and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers. The script should exclude certain directories (e.g. `/tmp`, `/var/log`) and compress the backup using `gzip`.
3. Set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups. The remote server should use SSH for secure communication.
4. Modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the rsync utility on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install rsync by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rsync
```

Once rsync is installed, you can configure it by editing the `/etc/rsync.conf` file. You can use a text editor like `nano` to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsync.conf
```

To set up a script that runs daily and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 0 * * * tar -czf /path/to/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/var/log /
```

This will run the tar command every day at midnight, creating a compressed archive of the entire file system (`/`) and excluding the `/tmp` and `/var/log` directories.

To set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups, you can use a variety of tools and techniques. One option is to install and configure a server application like openssh-server. On your pirate ship, run the following command to install openssh-server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y
```

Then, configure the server by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make any necessary changes to the configuration file (e.g. changing the default port number, enabling key-based authentication), then restart the server by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

To modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH, you can use the rsync command. First, create a new directory on the remote server to store the backups:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/backup
```

Then, run the following command to transfer the backups to the remote server:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/backup.tar.gz <remote server IP address>:/path/to/backup
```

#### Question 3: The Flying Dutchman

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a secure web server for the merchant vessel's website.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the Apache web server on the merchant vessel's servers. The web server should use the default port number and serve the website from the `/var/www/html` directory.
2. Set up a script that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager. If any updates are available, the script should install them.
3. Set up a cron job that runs every day at midnight and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers. The script should exclude certain directories (e.g. `/tmp`, `/var/log`) and compress the backup using `gzip`.
4. Set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups. The remote server should use SSH for secure communication.
5. Modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the Apache web server on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install Apache by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
```

Once Apache is installed, you can configure it by editing the `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file. You can use a text editor like `nano` to do this:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```

To set up a script that runs every hour and checks for updates to the system's package manager, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 * * * * apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

This will run the `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade -y` commands every hour. The `apt-get update` command checks for updates to the package manager, and the `apt-get upgrade -y` command installs any available updates.

To set up a cron job that runs every day at midnight and creates a full system backup of the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the crontab command. First, open the crontab editor for the root user by running the following command:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Then, add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
0 0 * * * tar -czf /path/to/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/tmp --exclude=/var/log /
```

This will run the tar command every day at midnight, creating a compressed archive of the entire file system (`/`) and excluding the `/tmp` and `/var/log` directories.

To set up a remote server on your pirate ship to store the backups, you can use a variety of tools and techniques. One option is to install and configure a server application like openssh-server. On your pirate ship, run the following command to install openssh-server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server -y
```

Then, configure the server by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make any necessary changes to the configuration file (e.g. changing the default port number, enabling key-based authentication), then restart the server by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

To modify the daily backup script to transfer the backups to the remote server using rsync over SSH, you can use the rsync command. First, create a new directory on the remote server to store the backups:

```bash
mkdir /path/to/backup
```

Then, run the following command to transfer the backups to the remote server:

```bash
rsync -avz -e ssh /path/to/backup.tar.gz <remote server IP address>:/path/to/backup
```

#### Question 4: Operation Blackbeard

**Question:**

You are the captain of a pirate ship and have just captured a merchant vessel. The merchant vessel's captain has agreed to hand over all of their valuable cargo in exchange for safe passage back to port. However, before the transfer can take place, you need to ensure that the merchant vessel's computers and servers are secure.

As the resident Linux expert on your pirate ship, you have been tasked with setting up a version control system for the merchant vessel's servers.

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks:

1. Install and configure the git version control system on the merchant vessel's servers.
2. Initialize a new git repository in the `/var/www/html` directory.
3. Add all of the files in the `/var/www/html` directory to the repository and commit the changes with the message `"Initial commit"`.
4. Set up a remote repository on your pirate ship using a service like GitHub or GitLab.
5. Connect the local repository on the merchant vessel's servers to the remote repository on your pirate ship.

**Answer:**

To install and configure the git version control system on the merchant vessel's servers, you can use the apt-get command. First, update the package manager's list of available packages by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, install `git` by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Once git is installed, you can configure it by running the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your@email.com"` with your own name and email address.

To initialize a new git repository in the `/var/www/html` directory, navigate to that directory and run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This will create a new git repository in the current directory.

To add all of the files in the `/var/www/html` directory to the repository and commit the changes with the message `"Initial commit"`, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

The `git add` command stages all of the files in the current directory for commit, and the `git commit` command commits the changes with the specified message.

To set up a remote repository on your pirate ship using a service like GitHub or GitLab, you will need to create an account on the service and create a new repository. Follow the service's instructions for creating a new repository.

To connect the local repository on the merchant vessel's servers to the remote repository on your pirate ship, you will need to add the remote repository as a remote for your local repository. First, copy the URL of the remote repository from the service's website. Then, run the following command in your local repository:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
```

Replace `<remote repository URL>` with the actual URL of the remote repository. This will add the remote repository as a remote named `"origin"` for your local repository. To push your local commits to the remote repository, run the following command:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

This will push the local master branch to the remote repository.

## Jokes

I'm not sure where to put this yet, but here they are.

### Check Yer Deployments

A group of pirates were setting sail on a new adventure, but they quickly ran into trouble. The ship's devops pirate had accidentally deployed the anchor instead of the sails, and they were stuck in the harbor.

The captain, a seasoned veteran of the high seas, knew they needed to act fast. "We need to redeploy the sails and set sail immediately," he yelled. "But how are we going to do that with the anchor deployed?" asked the devops pirate, frantically trying to fix the mistake.

"Leave that to me," replied the captain, pulling out his trusty sword. "I'll just cut the anchor's deployment pipeline and redeploy the sails manually." And with a mighty swing, he severed the anchor's deployment pipeline and the ship was finally on its way.

From then on, the devops pirate made sure to double check his deployments before setting sail. And the rest of the crew lived happily ever after, sailing the seas and deploying their sails with ease.

### Late to the Party

Why was the devops pirate always late to meetings?

He kept deployin' the wrong island!
