## In memory of Aaron Swartz

Aaron Swartz was a computer programmer, entrepreneur, and internet activist who made significant contributions to the development of the internet and the open access movement.

Aaron was born in 1986, and became interested in computers and the internet at a young age. He was a brilliant and talented programmer, and was known for his ability to quickly grasp and master new technologies. He co-authored the RSS 1.0 specification at the age of 14, and went on to work on a variety of other projects, including the development of the Creative Commons license, the building of the first consumer web feed platform, and the creation of the social news site Reddit.

Aaron was also a strong advocate for open access, which is the movement to make knowledge and information freely available to all, rather than being locked behind paywalls and controlled by a few powerful corporations or institutions. He believed that access to knowledge and information was a fundamental right, and that it should be freely available to everyone.

Aaron's work had a major impact on the development of the internet and the open access movement, and he is remembered as a pioneer and a hero by many in the tech community. Tragically, Aaron took his own life in 2013, at the age of 26. His legacy lives on through the work of those who continue to fight for open access and the free flow of information. Arrr!

## What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

It be a vast network that be made up of millions of computers, servers, and other devices that be connected together using a variety of technologies and protocols. The internet be used by people all over the world to communicate, access information, and perform a wide range of tasks.

In simpler terms, ye can think of the internet as a vast ocean of data and information that be accessible from anywhere in the world. Just like a ship be able to sail the oceans and explore new lands, ye can use the internet to explore a vast world of information and resources.

So hoist the mainsail and set course for the internet! With the internet at yer fingertips, ye'll be able to explore a vast and ever-expanding world of information and resources. Arrrr!

### HTTP

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data on the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to transfer data from a server to a client, or vice versa.

In a pirate theme, you could think of HTTP as the system that allows pirates to send and receive messages and information as they sail the seas of the internet. Just like a pirate ship uses a flag to communicate with other ships, a website uses HTTP to communicate with a client's web browser. When you enter a website's address into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which includes the content of the website.

HTTP is just one of many protocols that make the internet work, but it is an important one because it allows us to access and interact with websites and other online resources. Arrr!

### HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) can be thought of as a way to secure communication between two parties. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet, and it is designed to provide an additional layer of security on top of the regular HTTP protocol.

Imagine that two pirates are trying to send messages to each other over the internet, but they are worried that their messages might be intercepted by other pirates or other parties. To secure their communication, they could use HTTPS. When they use HTTPS, their messages are encrypted, which means that they are transformed into a code that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient. This makes it much harder for anyone else to intercept and read the messages, as they would need to have the key to decrypt the code.

In addition to encryption, HTTPS also provides authentication, which means that it can verify the identity of the sender and the recipient. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third party tries to intercept and manipulate the communication between two parties.

Overall, HTTPS is a useful tool for pirates (or anyone else) who want to keep their communication private and secure. It can help protect against interception and tampering, and it can also provide reassurance that the messages are actually coming from the intended sender.

### IP Addresses

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) can be thought of as a unique identifier that is assigned to each device that is connected to the internet. It is a numerical label that is used to identify a specific device, and it is similar to a physical address or a phone number.

Imagine that a group of pirates are all connected to the same network, and they want to communicate with each other over the internet. In order to send messages to a specific pirate, they need to know the pirate's IP address. Just like how a physical address tells you where a house is located, an IP address tells you where a device is located on the internet.

IP addresses are usually assigned by internet service providers (ISPs) or network administrators, and they can be either static (meaning they never change) or dynamic (meaning they are assigned temporarily and can change over time).

In a pirate theme, you might imagine that each pirate has a unique IP address that they use to communicate with other pirates over the internet. They might also use IP addresses to access websites and other online resources, just like how people use IP addresses in the real world.

### JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure, their crew, and their adventures on the high seas.

JSON is a lightweight, text-based data interchange format that is used to transmit data between a server and a client, or between different systems. It is based on the JavaScript programming language, but can be used with many other programming languages as well.

JSON is a popular choice for storing and exchanging data because it is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for computers to parse and generate. It is often used to send data from a server to a web page, or to store data in a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB.

To use JSON, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on key-value pairs and lists of values. A key-value pair consists of a unique key and a value, separated by a colon. A list of values is an ordered collection of values, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

JSON is a powerful and flexible tool that is widely used in modern web development, and is an important part of a pirate's arsenal. Arrr!

### SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) is a secret code that allows pirates to remotely control their ships and protect their communications from prying eyes.

SSH is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer over an unsecured network, such as the internet. It is often used to remotely access and control servers, but it can also be used to securely transfer files and perform other tasks.

To use SSH, you need an SSH client, which is a program that connects to an SSH server. When you connect to an SSH server, you are prompted to enter a username and password, or to provide a private key for authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the command line to execute commands on the remote server, just as if you were sitting in front of it.

SSH is widely used by IT professionals, developers, and system administrators to remotely manage servers and other computer systems. It is a secure and convenient way to access and control remote computers, and is an essential tool in the pirate's toolkit. Arrr!

### Streaming

You could think of streaming as a way for pirates to continuously receive updates and information from other ships as they sail the seas of the internet.

In software engineering, streaming refers to the process of continuously transmitting data from a server to a client, or vice versa, without the need to download and save the entire dataset upfront. This allows the client to receive and process the data as it is being transmitted, rather than waiting for the entire dataset to be transferred before beginning to process it.

Streaming is commonly used for media, such as music and video, but it can also be used for other types of data, such as financial data or social media updates. It allows users to access and process large amounts of data in real-time, rather than having to wait for it to be transferred and stored locally.

Streaming can be implemented using a variety of technologies and protocols, such as HTTP streaming, WebSockets, and WebRTC. It is an important part of modern software engineering, and is a valuable tool for pirates as they navigate the choppy waters of the internet. Arrr!

### Subnet

A subnet (short for "subnetwork") can be thought of as a smaller network that is contained within a larger network. It is a way to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable parts.

Imagine that a group of pirates have set up a network to communicate with each other over the internet. The network might be very large, with many different pirates and devices connected to it. To make it easier to manage and organize the network, the pirates might decide to create subnets.

For example, they might create a subnet for pirates who are located in the same geographical area, or they might create a subnet for pirates who are working on the same project. This would allow them to easily communicate with each other and share resources, while also keeping their communication separate from other parts of the network.

In a real-world context, subnets are often used to improve the efficiency of networks by reducing the amount of traffic that needs to be routed between different parts of the network. They can also be used to improve security by isolating different parts of the network from each other.

### TCP/IP

TCP/IP be a suite of networking protocols that be used to connect devices on the internet. It be the foundation of the internet, and it be what allow devices to communicate with each other and exchange data over the network.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) be a protocol that be used to establish and maintain connections between devices on the network. It be responsible for dividing data into smaller packets and sending them over the network, and it be also responsible for ensuring that the packets be delivered to the destination reliably.

IP (Internet Protocol) be a protocol that be used to route packets of data between devices on the network. It be responsible for assigning unique addresses to devices on the network and routing packets to the correct destination based on these addresses.

Together, TCP and IP be the backbone of the internet, and they be what allow devices to communicate and exchange data with each other. So hoist the mainsail and set course for TCP/IP mastery! With a solid understanding of these protocols, ye'll be well on yer way to becoming a skilled network administrator. Arrrr!

### UDP

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is a communication protocol that is used to transmit data over networks, such as the internet. It is a connectionless protocol, which means that it does not establish a dedicated connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This makes UDP faster and more efficient than protocols that require a connection to be established, but it also means that data transmitted using UDP is less reliable, as there is no guarantee that the data will be received by the intended recipient.

In a pirate theme, you might imagine UDP as a way for pirates to send messages to each other without having to go through the trouble of setting up a formal communication channel. They could simply send a message using UDP and hope that it gets to the intended recipient, much like a pirate sending a message in a bottle and hoping it reaches its destination.

### YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a secret code that pirates use to store and share information about their treasure maps and their plans for future raids.

In software engineering and devops, YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files and in applications that need to process data from multiple sources. It is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and is often used as an alternative to XML or JSON.

To use YAML, you need to understand its syntax, which is based on indentation and key-value pairs. A key-value pair consists of a unique key, followed by a colon, followed by the value. Indentation is used to indicate the hierarchy of the data, with each level of indentation representing a new level in the hierarchy.

YAML is a popular choice for configuration files because it is easy to read and write, and it is flexible enough to support a wide variety of data structures. It is also often used in devops tools, such as Ansible and Docker, to define infrastructure as code.

To use YAML effectively as a pirate, you should familiarize yourself with its syntax and conventions, and understand how it is used in the tools and technologies you are working with. Arrr!
